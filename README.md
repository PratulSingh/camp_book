# Getting started with Cloud9 on Amazon Web Services (AWS)

- Sign up [here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start)
- Select **Personal** for account type
- AWS requires a valid phone number for verification
- Your credit/debit card will also be charged $1 for verification purposes, the amount will be refunded after being processed
	- See [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/aws-authorization-charges/) for more information about the charge
- Select the *Free* **Basic Plan**
	- This plan is free for 12 months with certain usage restrictions, set a date in your calender to cancel your plan if you don't want to be charged after one year
	- See more details about the free plan [here](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?sc_channel=em&sc_campaign=wlcm&sc_publisher=aws&sc_medium=em_wlcm_1d&sc_detail=wlcm_1d&sc_content=other&sc_country=global&sc_geo=global&sc_category=mult&ref_=pe_1679150_261538020)
- Sign in to the AWS console with your new account
	- It can take up to 24 hours for your account to be verified, check your email for notification
- Once logged in you'll be in the AWS dashboard
- Click the **Cloud9** link, otherwise type **cloud9** into the **AWS services** search bar and select **Cloud9 A Cloud IDE for Writing, Running, and Debugging Code**
- If your account has been verified then you will be able to select **Create environment**
- Name it **wdb** and click **Next step**
- *Leave default settings* and click **Next step** again
- Scroll down and click **Create environment**

## Check node and npm

- Once inside your c9 environment (previously called a workspace) type `node -v` into the terminal, you should see v6.11.4 or greater (current version being used at the time of the making of this tutorial)
- Now type `npm -v`, you should see 3.10.10 (or higher)

## MongoDB Instructions
*(skip this section and see below for MySQL Instructions if coming from MySQL course)*

- Enter `touch mongodb-org-3.6.repo` into the terminal
- Now open the **mongodb-org-3.6.repo** file in your code editor (select it from the left-hand file menu) and paste the following into it then save the file:

```
[mongodb-org-3.6]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/amazon/2013.03/mongodb-org/3.6/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-3.6.asc
```

- Now run the following in your terminal:

```
sudo mv mongodb-org-3.6.repo /etc/yum.repos.d
sudo yum install -y mongodb-org
```
- Close the **mongodb-org-3.6.repo** file and press **Close tab** when prompted
- Change directories back into root ~ by entering `cd` into the terminal then enter the following commands:

```
mkdir data
echo 'mongod --dbpath=data --nojournal' > mongod
chmod a+x mongod
```

- Now test mongod with `./mongod`
- Remember, you must first enter `cd` to change directories into root ~ before running `./mongod`
- Don't forget to shut down ./mongod with `ctrl + c` each time you're done working

That's it! You're all set :)

## MySQL Instructions

- Enter `sudo service mysqld start` into the terminal
- Enter `/usr/libexec/mysql55/mysql_secure_installation` and follow the steps for setting up your root account and password.
	- When prompted for the initial password press enter
		- If this step fails then enter `/usr/libexec/mysql55/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'`
			- Be sure to replace `'new-password'` with your password
		- Now start the secure installation over again with `/usr/libexec/mysql55/mysql_secure_installation` and enter the password you just created
	- Disable remote root access and remove test database and anonymous user during the secure installation steps

- Start the mysql shell with root user access by entering: `mysql -uroot -p` and typing in your root password when prompted
	- Password will be hidden while typing it in, press enter when done typing and the shell will start if the password is correct
- Once inside of the shell test it out with the following commands:



```
CREATE database test;
USE test;
CREATE TABLE pet (name VARCHAR(20), owner VARCHAR(20), species VARCHAR(20));
INSERT INTO pet (name, owner, species) VALUES('Loki', 'Ian', 'Dog');                                                                                                                                                    
SELECT * FROM pet;
```

**Result:**

```
+------+-------+---------+
| name | owner | species |
+------+-------+---------+
| Loki | Ian   | Dog     |
+------+-------+---------+
```
- When you're done working you can exit the shell by typing `exit` or pressing `ctrl + c`
- Stop the mysql daemon with `sudo service mysqld stop`
